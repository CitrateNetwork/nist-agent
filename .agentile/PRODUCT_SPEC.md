# PRODUCT_SPEC.md — What the Finished Product Does

> **TEMPLATE.** `bootstrap.sh` will seed this from your answers; the
> rest is on you to fill in as the project takes shape. This file is
> the answer to "is this in scope?" If a feature isn't in PRODUCT_SPEC,
> it's out of scope until added explicitly.

## Vision

Two paragraphs answering: what does the finished product let a user
do that they cannot do today? Why does that matter?

## Modules

For each module of the product, one paragraph:

### `<module-1>`

**Purpose:** what the module does.
**Surface:** what it exposes (API, CLI, GUI, RPC method names, etc.).
**Out of scope:** what it explicitly does *not* do.
**Acceptance:** how we know it's done — referenced from the relevant
sprint's WPs.

### `<module-2>`

(Repeat per module.)

## Non-goals

Explicit list of things this product is **not**. Helps later when
someone proposes a feature that drifts from the original intent —
non-goals are the "we already discussed this and decided no" line.

## Assumptions

What we're assuming about users, infrastructure, regulation, or
upstream dependencies. Each assumption has a date and a check we'll
revisit it.

## Success metrics

How we know the product is succeeding. Each metric has a baseline
(measured today) and a target (measured at the next major
milestone).

## Update protocol

Changes to this file are **planset-gated**: file a planset under
`planset/YYYY-MM-DD-<change>/` first, get review, then merge with
the planset reference in the commit message. Drive-by edits to the
product spec are not allowed.
