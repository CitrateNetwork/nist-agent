# Active audit reference — `nist-agent`

> This repo's two-way link into the centralized federation audit trail
> (Hybrid topology). It is what an outsider cloning *this* repo follows to the
> findings. The canonical audit home is the `citrate-security` repo.

This repo participates in the **Inaugural Federation Deep Audit** opened
2026-05-31 as a **Tier 1 — full audit** surface.

- Audit root: `citrate-security/audits/2026-05-31-federation-deep-audit/`
- This repo's folder: `.../per-repo/nist-agent/` — `MAP.md` (architecture + data-flow +
  two Mermaid diagrams) and `INVENTORY.md` (feature/app/function table)
- Findings roll-up: `.../06_FINDINGS.md`
- Audit index: `citrate-security/audits/AUDIT_INDEX.md`
- Standard: `citrate-security/.agentile/standard/AGENTILE_AUDIT_STANDARD.md`

## Local evidence (Hybrid topology)

Remediation diffs and post-fix e2e/regression evidence for findings against this
repo land **here**, next to the code, under
`.agentile/audits/2026-05-31-federation-deep-audit/` and are linked back from the
central finding.

## Scope for this repo

- Phase-1 mapping complete; see `per-repo/nist-agent/MAP.md` for the mapped surface and
  the high-risk areas queued for Phase-2 vuln-hunting.
