"""Rule 6 enforcer: audit reports are dated and immutable.

Walks `.agentile/audits/` and, for each `.md` file, checks that no
commit AFTER the file's first-commit modified its content. Renames
and deletions are also forbidden — a finding that was wrong gets a
NEW dated audit, not an edit to the original.

The check is a git-log walk: for every file under audits/, run
`git log --follow --diff-filter=M --format=%H -- <file>`. If that
returns more than one commit (the create commit), the file has been
modified and the rule is violated.

Exit codes:
  0 — every audit file is immutable
  1 — at least one audit file was modified after creation; lists offenders
  2 — usage / git error

Flags:
  --since <commit>   Only check files modified in commits after `<commit>`
                     (used by audit-immutability.yml on PRs to scope to
                     the diff range).
